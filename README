AMI Exposed was first released at Defcon 19 in 2011.  It's a framework for testing of EC2 AMIs (Amazon Machine Images.)  Largely, it's a set of extensions to Amazon's AWS-SDK for Ruby (see http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/) adding some helpful methods to their classes, and a few new classes.

The Defcon presentation is the most official reference, but this file should help in getting started.

##### Pre-Reqs #####
Many Ruby gems are used throughout the tool, and must be installed in order for it to function properly.

- aws-sdk-for-ruby - 
	http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/
	https://github.com/amazonwebservices/aws-sdk-for-ruby
- active_record - 
	http://rubygems.org/gems/activerecord
- threaded_collections - 
	http://github.com/peteonrails/threadedcollections/tree/master
	http://blog.peteonrails.com/?page_id=44
- net-ssh - 
	http://rubygems.org/gems/net-ssh

##### Configuration #####
In the config/config.yaml file that controls most aspects of the configuration.  At a minimum you'll need to; 
	- Provide AWS access_key_id
	- Provide AWS  secret_access_key
	- Provide SSH key_path
	- Provide SSH key_name (Must match both the keyfile, and the name in EC2!)
	- Add your scan source IP(s) to ignore_host_connections:
		If scanning from an EC2 instance, include both public and private IPs.
		
##### Database Configuration #####
We ship with a working SQLLite configuration in config/database.yaml.  A blank SQLLite DB is stored in db/local/sqlite3

If you wish to use a different database adapter, modify config/database.yaml and rake to import our db migration.
